The world is full of problems. Some of these can be solved through the use of technology. Other problems can't be solved directly through the use of technology, but the deployment of technologies can impact social enviroments and social interactions in a way so that the problems not solvable directly though technology can be addressed.

Low-resource languages suffer from one of the problems of the second type. That is there is a sociological problem that follows breifly in the following way:

Feelgood, and dogood linguists often want to help "low-resourced" language community have digital tools in their language. This scenario is mirrorred by the a different senario, which may be contrasted with people "helping" from the outside. That is,people from within the low-resource langauge want to create tools for using their language - often in written form - in digital contexts.
The result is that there are often a set of persons who are project managers, or who hold the business strings (access to grant funding, and are responsible for contracting with technologists to impelement the project ideas and goals).
The problem that occurs is that the more project managers there are (which might be more than one per language - with over 7,000 languages) the more divergent the technological solutions which are expensive and often not compatable or extenible - even if they are "open sourced".

Problem we are trying to solve is the communication problem between the plethroa of coders which vary from cowboy soloists to dedicated shops working on language software targeted for use in Low-resourced communities, and the growing number of visionary project managers, who might have a background in linguistics, but often not have one in information technology or in information technology project management.

The beneifits of collaboration, and reusability of code are obvious. However, there still stand a large gap between the project manager and the coding technolgist. We find that this gap can be characterized by two critical problems: 

1. What are the things which have been codded - and for what purpose are they coded? 
2. Assuming that this data can be gathered, how can this data be quicky made usable so that project managers can use the information intenegently in their evolving relationships with their technical teams? In summary we must create a pile of data, and then we need to make it usable.

In the sprit of taking baby steps, we have started to ammas a pile of data (asking the question - what do we know has been coded), we have started with a solution which is more native to coders than to project managers. We have used an element of Github culture - 'the Awesome list'. 

While this does list does make a browseable list, it does not address the mryad of points of view which project managers come from. Synethsizing the data to match the various points of view; making the data relevant and usable is still an open task.
